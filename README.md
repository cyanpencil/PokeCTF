You can try a live version [here](http://www.cyanpencil.xyz:5000)

# setup
`pip install -r pokectf/requirements.txt`. You also need [aha](https://github.com/theZiz/aha) to generate ANSI art.

PokeCTF uses a docker container for the web server, and a docker container for each interactive challenge that must be hosted on the server.

Edit and run `deploy.sh` to spawn all the docker containers and run the CTF. 

# Ansi art 
Each time a random pokemon from the first 40 of the first collection will be served in ANSI art. 

ANSI art images were generate with [ansize](https://www.github.com/jhchen/ansize) and then converted to HTML with [aha](https://github.com/theZiz/aha). 

You can generate your own images by placing them in `pokectf/pokemon_sprites/pokemon/[0..40].png` and running `pokectf/generate_pokemon_ascii.sh`. They will be placed in `pokemon/banners/poke[0..40].html` and served at random.
